I"ÿ<p>Suppose you had sample = tensor([[3,5,4] Â  [0,2,1]])</p>

<p>Then these will all return the <em>exact</em> same output:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sample.repeat(2,1)</li>
  <li>sample.view(1,-1).expand(2,-1).contiguous().view(4,3)</li>
  <li>sample.index_select(0, tensor([0,1,0,1])</li>
  <li>torch. cat( [sample, sample], 0 )
<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--></li>
</ul>

<p>Explanations</p>

<ul>
  <li>Repeat - this is the correct tool for the job</li>
  <li>Expand - meant for expanding a tensor when one of the dimensions is a singleton
    <ul>
      <li>in other words, if the sample is (4,1) and we want to repeat (4,3)</li>
      <li>we should use sample.expand(4,3) and not sample.repeat(1,3)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Index Select - meant for re-ordering the items in a tensor
    <ul>
      <li>so we might have a tensor that was shuffled, and we want to shuffle it back into place</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Concat - meant for joining together two different tensors
    <ul>
      <li>also, do not confuse with torch.stack, which would add an extra dimension</li>
      <li>concat a list of four 2x3 matrices and you will get 8x3 back</li>
      <li>stack a list of four 2x3 matrices and you will get 4x2x3 back
