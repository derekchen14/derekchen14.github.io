I"P<p>When trying to understand user belief, a NLU model attempts to track the intent over the length of the conversation.  However, what format should this intent be represented?  Is it continuous or discrete?  It it directly passed into the Policy Manager or should it be augmented first?  Hundreds of hours and effort will be spent finding labels for training such a model, so it seems reasonable we should agree on what format this label should take.  But considering the issue in any depth will show trade-offs in different label formats, so the answer is not immediately obvious.</p>
