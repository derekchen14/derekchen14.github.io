I"v<p>For awhile from 2015 to 2020 it seemed as if every start-up touted itself to be powered by AI.  The buzz around artificial intelligence has faded a bit, probably because it’s clear that AGI is not just around the corner and also because the media is always looking for the next shiny thing to discuss.  But for those of us in the trenches thinking about AI research every day, there remains a critical question to ask - is this latest round of AI, namely around deep learning with SGD, merely a feature to sprinkle onto existing tools and services, or is this truly a new foundation on which to build new technologies?</p>
