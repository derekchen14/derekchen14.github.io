I"—<p>For my Stanford <a href="http://cs231n.stanford.edu">Convolutional Neural Networks course</a>, I partnered with a brilliant friend of mine to analyze images from a collection of 40,000 digitized works of art by classifying them according to artist, genre, and location.  After some standard pre-processing, we employed a modified VGGNet architecture to achieve better than <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.00855v1.pdf">state-of-the-art results</a> on artist and genre classification. Along the way though, we hit a number of roadblocks, and saw <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Error allocating 86118400 bytes of device memory (out of memory). Driver report 32735232 bytes free and 4294770688 bytes total.  Segmentation fault (core dumped)</code> more times than we would like to remember.  In getting our network to  run to properly, we encountered a number of problems and their solutions.</p>
