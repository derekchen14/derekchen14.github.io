# Starting Up
Use the `_drafts` directory for writing something new
When the draft is complete, move it into `_posts` for publication

Each post will have the following key fields:
  layout: post
  title: the title of the blog post
  tags: [A Tag, Test, Lorem, Ipsum]
  excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

  * The actual content goes here *

## Local Development
To serve locally, run `bundle exec jekyll serve`, then head to http://localhost:4000 to view

## Remote Deployment
To publish to the web, simply commit changes and push to Github!
