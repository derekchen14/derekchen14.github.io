I"<p>Building a product can be quite simple, but the best ones include insights from human behavior, algorithmic efficiency, and usability.  To start, an engineer might build a sophisticated app that uses some cutting edge technology. It is a non-trivial feat which required:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Speaking the language of mathematics in order to talk to the computer</li>
  <li>Pulling from a toolbox of various algorithms</li>
  <li>Manifesting itself as an app through programming</li>
</ul>

<p>A solid understanding of this aspect means you have a feasible product.  But that is not enough.  You have a solution, but possibly no problem.   Thus, analyst might come along to add some vision that takes into account a meaningful customer pain point (read: something that hurts enough people will pay for it).  This is also a substantial feat which required:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Speaking the language of the target customer, oftentimes through mediums as varied as body language to analytics.</li>
  <li>Pulling from a toolbox of various strategic frameworks</li>
  <li>Manifesting itself a product roadmap through planning prioritization</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, the product is not only feasible, but it is also economically viable.  You have a solution and a problem that is solves, which makes a good product.  Still not enough.  The original criteria was building <em>great</em> products, so more work needs to be done.  Next, a designer might come along to improve the usability of the app that takes into account user feedback.  This amazing feat requires:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Speaking the language of creativity (?) I’m not sure here because I am not an expert</li>
  <li>Pulling from a toolbox of design patterns and UX heuristics</li>
  <li>Manifesting itself as well-designed user interface and user interactions</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, we have a product that is feasible, viable and desirable.  We have a great product.  All it took was the combined expertise of several industry leaders, and an idealized world where egos, politics and time pressures don’t exist.</p>
