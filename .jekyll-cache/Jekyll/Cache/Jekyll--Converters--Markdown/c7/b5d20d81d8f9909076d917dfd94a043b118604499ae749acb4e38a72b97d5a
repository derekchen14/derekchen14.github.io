I"¿<p>Compared to typical goal-oriented dialogue systems, interactive dialogue agents not only aim to solve the task at hand, but also engage with the user by asking questions. Â Questions can be used to push the conversation forward or to spark some new ideas, but for now we will focus on the use of questions to clarify understanding. Â <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Matthew_Purver/publication/236273309_The_Theory_and_Use_of_Clarification_Requests_in_Dialogue/links/00b7d5313817a20f30000000/The-Theory-and-Use-of-Clarification-Requests-in-Dialogue.pdf">Clarification requests</a>, as they are referred to in the academic literature, come in many forms, but the key issues to solve are when to ask such questions and in what format. Â Asking questions too often, or at inappropriate times, causes the conversation to feel disjointed or annoying. Â Asking the wrong type of question causes the dialogue agent to seem incoherent or useless.</p>
