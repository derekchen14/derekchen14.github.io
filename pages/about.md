Derek is a Research Engineer working on designing intelligent dialogue systems with stronger natural langauge understanding.  His research is focused on data efficiency methods including active learning, data augmentation and meta-learning.  He is also interested in techniques surrounding uncertainty measurement so that a dialogue agent can better manage ambiguity and out-of-scope situtations.

He attended numerous Computer Science courses at Stanford University, and eventually graduated with a masters in CS from the University of Washington.  This blog is about the journey in building a qualitatively superior virtual assistant and the start-up surrounding this product.  Specifically, the assistant will focus on listening rather than responding, understanding rather than reacting.  In other words, the assistant will move beyond executing commands and towards conversations that last more than one turn.
