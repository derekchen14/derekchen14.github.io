Derek is a Research Scientist working on designing intelligent dialogue systems with stronger natural language understanding.  His research is focused on efficiently training NLP models in low resource settings including data augmentation, data denoising, and few-shot learning.  He is also interested in techniques surrounding uncertainty measurement so that a dialogue agent can better manage ambiguity and out-of-scope situations. He ultimately believes that a data-centric view of machine learning will usher in a wave of much more useful services than what we see today.

Derek attended numerous Computer Science courses at Stanford University, and eventually graduated with a masters in CS from the University of Washington.  This blog is about the journey in building a qualitatively superior virtual assistant and the start-up surrounding this product.  Specifically, the assistant will focus on listening rather than responding, understanding rather than reacting.  In other words, the assistant will move beyond executing commands and towards conversations that last more than one turn.
