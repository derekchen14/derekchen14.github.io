I"Ñ<p>Given the goal of creating an optimal recommendation system, one could consider using a neural turing machine (NTM) with a ‚Äúprogrammable‚Äù head performing read/write operations on the various inputs in order to generate a prediction.  The inputs would be encoding of the situation (shopping for clothes), encodings of the options (sweater, jacket, T-shirt, dress shirt) along with their features of those options (blue/green, soft, polyester, wool), tons of other previously collected data points, and obviously a vector embedding of the individual for whom we are making the recommendation.  The predictions would just the result of softmax classifier with thousands of possibilities, each one representing a cluster of clothing items.  (There is no need to recommend just one item because eve a mobile UI can display 7-10 items fairly easily to let the customer make the final decision.)</p>
