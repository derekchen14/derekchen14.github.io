Founders over Ideas

  - Founders who are relentlessly resourceful
  - Founders who are authentic, and live in reality, yet still bring a sense of wonder since their conviction about the new world is so strong
  - Ideas that are a little bit fearsome, because you realize that this change is inexorable, and you are either going to be part of it or you can miss out, but I'm going to rock it either way.

You must think, "I am successful not because YC invested in me, I am successful because I do the things that successful people do."
